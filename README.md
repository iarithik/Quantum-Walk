Summary of the Project (in 500 words):

The Galton board, is a classical probability device where balls are dropped from the top and bounce off pegs, moving randomly left or right before landing in bins. Each bounce is a 50/50 decision, and over many trials, the resulting distribution of balls follows a Gaussian curve. A quantum Galton board replaces these random choices with quantum superposition and interference, enabling the particle to take multiple paths simultaneously. This produces output distributions that may differ significantly from the classical Gaussian. Qubits are used to represent both the “coin” that decides the direction and the “position” of the particle.

In the single-peg case, a classical ball hits the peg and randomly moves left or right. On a quantum circuit, this is modeled with three position qubits (q₁, q₂, q₃) and one control qubit (q₀). The control qubit acts as the “coin” and is placed into superposition with a Hadamard gate, representing the 50/50 chance. An X-gate marks the starting position on the middle qubit (q₂). Controlled-SWAP gates, with q₀ as the controller, move the “ball” left or right to q₁ and q₃ in superposition—simulating both possibilities at once. An inverted CNOT can reset q₀ if needed. Measurement of q₁ and q₃ gives the final bin. This setup can be duplicated across layers to build a multi-layer quantum Galton board.

Building on this idea, a generalized algorithm was developed to generate a quantum Galton board circuit with any number of layers. In each layer, the coin qubit is placed into superposition using a Hadamard gate, followed by controlled-SWAP operations to update the position qubits. After all layers, the circuit is measured to obtain the final distribution. Running this algorithm on a noiseless simulator for many shots yields a Gaussian-like distribution when the number of layers is large, closely matching the classical binomial pattern with subtle quantum deviations due to interference.

Beyond reproducing Gaussian distributions, the quantum Galton board can be modified to achieve other target distributions. For example, an exponential distribution can be generated by replacing the fair Hadamard coin with biased rotation gates such as Ry(θ), skewing the probabilities of stepping left or right. Adjusting the biases across layers reshapes the distribution, demonstrating the flexibility of quantum circuit design for statistical modeling.

The Hadamard walk described here is a discrete-time quantum walk using a coin qubit and a position register encoded in unary form. In a classical random walk, a coin flip decides whether to step left or right. In the quantum version, the coin qubit is placed into superposition with a Hadamard gate, allowing simultaneous “heads” and “tails” outcomes. The walker’s position is stored in unary form: exactly one qubit is in ∣1⟩ and the rest in ∣0⟩. Moving left or right swaps the ∣1⟩ using controlled-SWAP gates, with the direction determined by the coin state. Because the coin is in superposition, both shifts occur simultaneously, creating entanglement between coin and position. Over many steps, quantum interference amplifies some paths and cancels others, producing a final position distribution with distinctive peaks and dips, unlike the smooth Gaussian of a classical walk.
